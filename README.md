# hypermarket-api
A simple api for items in a hypermarket (think walmart, meijer, etc.).
Built to demonstrate an API for a simple hierarchy of data.\
[Published OpenAPI Page](https://peckrog.github.io/hypermarket-api/index.html)
## Running the project
To run the project start the grizzly server
`mvn exec:java`.
Then the database needs to be started next using `docker-compose up -d`

## Tools used
* Jersey
* Openapi
* jOOQ
* MySQL
* Github Actions

## Thought Process Notes
Here are some notes on the choices I made, limitations, or future work I would do to
improve this.
### [hypermarketAPI.yaml](src/main/resources/hypermarketAPI.yaml)
* I used this openapi file to design the API and autogenerated the
[models](src/main/java/com/hypermarketAPI/model) and [API interface](src/main/java/com/hypermarketAPI/api/HypermarketsApi.java) for me

### [The DAO files](src/main/java/com/hypermarketAPI/dao)
* It seems like the best way to use jOOQ is to use the generated files that it is capable of creating
however I had trouble getting this setup so I used plain sql.
  
* I would like to figure out a better way to get the created id when creating an item

* I would also like to improve the batch creation of grocery item code in order to not create any item if one is invalid

### [Exception Mappers](src/main/java/com/hypermarketAPI/exception)
* These will catch any exception thrown and return the proper response, reducing the amount of try
  catch blocks I would need. (also doing this because I haven't been able to use this before)
